After using this solution: 
https://askubuntu.com/questions/1152570/npm-cant-find-module-semver-error-in-ubuntu-19-04

to fix the "cant find semwer error"
I installed npm and eslint.

Starting with: npx eslint --init (choose the right answer to the questions)

{style,none,none,no,browser,guide,airbnb,javascript,yes}

I used this command: npx eslint get-weather.js --fix

to fix all the errors

(errors like "linebreaks" , "must use singlequote" , indentation of 2 spaces but found 4", "unexpected string concatenation)

After fixing those, I used the command : npx prettier --write get-weather.js

problems eslint could not fix : Line 19 body => body.toString()
				 Line 22      => return 1;

Which replaced '' by "" and adjusted some parts of the code.

(which then... eslint wants to replace by singlequotes)


------------- Question 2 ---------------------------------

I used autopep8 for this question to automate the process.

Installing pip: sudo apt install python3-pip

Installing autopep8 : pip install --upgrade autopep8

Using autopep8 to modify the file in place :

autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive get-weather.js

source for this last command: https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/

I did my example with Lisbon: get-weather.py -n Lisbon search
				returns: City ID: 742676
			       get-weather.py -c 742676 get-weather
			        returns City: Lisbon; Weather State: Heavy Cloud
